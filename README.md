This repository contains all projects developed on C programming.

# Low-Level Overview

In the Low-Level Programming track, you will learn how programming languages and Unix systems work, "what is going on under the hood". This will allow you to optimize and debug anything later in your career. You will be working with algorithms and data structures which are essential foundations for any great Software Engineer, the type that the best companies want to hire.

Low-level programming involves languages that provide little or no abstraction from machine language. The more human readable and abstracted a language is from machine language, the more "higher level" it's considered.

The C programming language is used in embedded systems, kernel programming, hardware, and even to write higher level languages. Most of Linux and large parts of Windows are written in C, and even web servers and database software are developed with C. Created in 1972, C continues to be used all over the world of programming.

Make no mistake -- C can be a difficult language to start learning to program with; even some experienced engineers find it daunting! But don't worry, you have a cohort full of peers to support you and help you work through the projects.

## First Trimester

    Basics
    Functions
    Pointers

        Singly Linked Lists
    Bit Manipulation
    Variadic Functions
    Memory Management
    File Redirection
    `printf`
    Shell
    Compilation
    Heap/Stack
    Static Libraries


## Low-Level Basics

During the first trimester, you will learn general programming concepts that apply to all languages, such as loops, if/else statements, data structures, and more. You will learn how Unix systems work and gain an understanding of "what is going on under the hood" of these universally utilized systems.

You will also have two major partner projects:

    `printf`: recreating your own implementation of C's `printf` function
    Shell: creating your own shell that takes commands and executes them

You can find more information about the Shell project here.

Before you start your partner projects, make sure you understand how collaborating on Github works! Github errors are the cause of many struggles when it comes to partner projects.

In the second and third trimesters, you will be introduced to more advanced data structures and to well-known algorithms used in programming. On top of being essential towards software engineering, both advanced data structures and algorithms are often the subject of technical interviews, so it's important you have a solid understanding of them.

## Betty

At Holberton, we have a coding style called `Betty` and your C code must adhere to Betty's standards. You should be using Betty to check your code before you push it to Github, ensuring you have clean, readable code.
