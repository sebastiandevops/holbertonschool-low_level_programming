This repository contains all projects developed on C programming.

# Low-Level Overview

In the Low-Level Programming track, you will learn how programming languages and Unix systems work, "what is going on under the hood". This will allow you to optimize and debug anything later in your career. You will be working with algorithms and data structures which are essential foundations for any great Software Engineer, the type that the best companies want to hire.

Low-level programming involves languages that provide little or no abstraction from machine language. The more human readable and abstracted a language is from machine language, the more "higher level" it's considered.

The C programming language is used in embedded systems, kernel programming, hardware, and even to write higher level languages. Most of Linux and large parts of Windows are written in C, and even web servers and database software are developed with C. Created in 1972, C continues to be used all over the world of programming.

Make no mistake -- C can be a difficult language to start learning to program with; even some experienced engineers find it daunting! But don't worry, you have a cohort full of peers to support you and help you work through the projects.
